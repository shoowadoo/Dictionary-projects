# My Dictionary Projects

Project currently includes dictionaries for Esperanto and Gwich'in. A dictionary can be accessed online by clicking on its link below. 

For fun, check out a few words in each language, e.g., 'wear', 'snow', 'sun', 'reindeer', 'caribou', 'inhabit/inhabitant', etc.

Esperanto is fun! :) 

## Gwich'in
[Gwich'in Dictionary](https://shoowadoo.github.io/Dictionary-projects/gwichin-dictionary/)

Gwich'in is spoken in both Alaska and Canada. This dictionary focuses on Alaskan or Western Gwich'in, also known as [Dinjii Zhuh K'yaa](https://www.alaskanativelanguages.org/gwichin).

Although not necessary, the Gwich’in dictionary works well with the [Gwich’in keyboard](https://languagegeek.com/lgwp/keyboards/) which can be downloaded and installed on your own machine. Follow instructions for installation and use at that site.

Materials for learning and exploring more about Gwich'in can be found in the [Gwich'in Athabaskan Language Collection](https://www.uaf.edu/anla/collections/gwichin/) of the Alaska Native Language Archive in Fairbanks.

Updates: The user can now choose to search for either an English or Gwich'in word. Because there are several different orthographic styles, with the same word marked for tone and/or nasalization in one text and unmarked in another, the user can search for a Gwich'in word with or without special marks or diacritics.
