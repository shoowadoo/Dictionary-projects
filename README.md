Esperanto is fun! :) 

[Gwich'in Dictionary](https://shoowadoo.github.io/Dictionary-projects/gwichin-dictionary/)

Gwich'in is spoken in both Alaska and Canada. This dictionary focuses on Alaskan or Western Gwich'in, also known as [Dinjii Zhuh K'yaa](https://www.alaskanativelanguages.org/gwichin).

The Gwich’in dictionary works well with the [Gwich’in keyboard](https://languagegeek.com/lgwp/keyboards/) which can be downloaded and installed on your own machine. Follow instructions for installation and use at that site. 

Materials for learning more about Gwich'in can be found in the [Gwich'in Athabaskan Language Collection](https://www.uaf.edu/anla/collections/gwichin/) of the Alaska Native Language Archive in my hometown of Fairbanks.

Updates: The user can now choose to search either for an English or Gwich'in word. Because there are several different orthographic styles in different Gwich'in texts, with some vowels marked for tone and/or nasalization and others not, the user can search with or without special marks or diacritics.
