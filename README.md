# My Projects

Project currently includes dictionaries for Esperanto and Gwich'in. A dictionary can be accessed online by clicking on its link below. 

For fun, check out a few words in each language, e.g., 'wear', 'snow', 'sun', 'reindeer', 'caribou', 'inhabit/inhabitant', etc.

Esperanto is fun! :)

## Gwich'in
[Gwich'in Dictionary](https://shoowadoo.github.io/Dictionary-projects/gwichin-dictionary/)

Gwich'in is spoken in both Alaska and Canada. This dictionary focuses on Alaskan or Western Gwich'in, also known as [Dinjii Zhuh K'yaa](https://www.alaskanativelanguages.org/gwichin).

Although not necessary, the Gwich’in dictionary works well with the [Gwich’in keyboard](https://languagegeek.com/lgwp/keyboards/) which can be downloaded and installed on your own machine. Follow instructions for installation and use at that site.

While you can search using English infinitives in most cases, there may be times when you don't immediately get a hit, e.g., 'cry.' In this case, you might want to try searching for the word 'crying' or 'cries' or 'cried' instead. This is because Gwich'in verbs must be inflected (i.e., there are no infinitives) and so are listed in dictionary entries in their 3rd person present and/or past tense forms. However, this is not a guarantee, and there are many words still missing from this modest dictionary of approximately 3000 words.

Additional materials for learning and exploring more about Gwich'in can be found in the [Gwich'in Athabaskan Language Collection](https://www.uaf.edu/anla/collections/gwichin/) of the Alaska Native Language Archive in Fairbanks.

### Updates
The user can now choose to search for either an English or Gwich'in word. Because there are several different orthographic styles, with the same word marked for tone and/or nasalization in one text and unmarked in another, the user can search for a Gwich'in word with or without special marks or diacritics. In other words, searching for ’tǫǫ’ and ’too’ in the direction Gwich'in to English will produce the same result. In some cases, such a search strategy may produce ambiguous results, since tone marking can indeed change the meaning of a word (e.g., shih ’black bear’ vs. shìh ’food’). However, I'd rather users get a few false positives than nothing at all, in case the unknown word comes from a text with inconsistent or no marking at all.
